            <h3>Lisa Bruton</h3>
            <p>
                I am a happy mother, with one daughter aged 7 years and living with my
                husband, Ben. We have two pet rabbits- Toffee &amp; Betty and a cockatiel
                bird-Jim Jim, in our non-smoking Bracknell home.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy seeing children smiling and having fun and this created my passion
                for providing home from home childcare. By providing a safe and stimulating
                home environment which meets children's individual needs, I aim to support
                parents to enable them to balance work and family responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a fully qualified and Ofsted registered childminder, delivering
                childcare services in a warm and friendly environment. Ben & I both have
                enhanced Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks.

                <p>
                    We have a lovely secure garden with a vegetable patch, playhouse, sand/
                    water pit and ride on toys to encourage children to have fun and learn
                    through physical play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I cater indoor activities, to help children feel comfortable and encourage
                    interaction whilst having an educational value. For example cooking, messy
                    play, arts /crafts, singing /dancing and reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy daily outings either to the local parks, walks to the library,
                    visits to play/ toddler groups or indoor play centres. Weather permitting,
                    I also go on special outings, for example to Legoland, Odds Farm Park
                    and Windsor Castle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can provide nutritious hot and cold meals and I have a separate sleeping
                    room for little ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am happy to care for babies and children up to 11 years and my toys
                    and facilities reflect this. Whether you need care for your child all
                    day while you work or you require part time, before/after school hours,
                    I am flexible to help you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am able to cover the areas of Harmans Water, Crown Wood, Bullbrooke,
                    Forest Park, The Warren, Easthampstead, Birch Hill, Great Hollands and
                    Ascot, in the Bracknell Forest area, in Berkshire.
